<h2>Rhinoviruses</h2>
<p>LRhinoviruses are a group of viruses that are the most commonTrusted Source cause of the common cold. Symptoms of a cold may includeTrusted Source:

  a stuffy or runny nose
  sore throat
  headache
  A person can catch a rhinovirus by inhaling contaminated droplets from the cough or sneeze of another person.
  
  Similarly, rhinoviruses are spread by people touching their nose, eyes, or mouth after touching items or surfaces that have come into contact with the virus.</p>

<h2>Coronaviruses</h2>
<p> covid 19 are a large group of viruses that affect the respiratory systemTrusted Source. This family includes the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Some coronaviruses can cause common cold and flu symptoms, while others can cause more severe outcomes.
  COVID-19 can occur without any symptoms. It can also cause symptoms that are severe and complications that can be fatal. Doctors do not yet know the full impact that it has on the body, but COVID-19 commonly affects a person’s ability to breathe.

Even if a person has no symptoms, they can pass the infection to others. It is vital to take steps to prevent this.

There is no cure for COVID-19. To prevent the illness, take precautions, such as washing the hands frequently, wearing a face-covering in public, and staying away from others. Isolating is especially crucial for people who feel ill.

Vaccines are becoming available and are free for everyone in the United States

COVID-19 results from an infection with a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses. These range from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

The symptoms of COVID-19 may begin 2–14 daysTrusted Source after exposure to the virus, and they can vary widely. A person may have no symptoms, or the symptoms may range from mild to severe. In some cases, COVID-19 is fatal.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the disease may cause:

a fever, chills or both
a cough
difficulty breathing
fatigue
a headache
muscle aches
a new loss of taste or smell
a sore throat
nasal congestion or a runny nose
nausea or vomiting
diarrhea
The World Health Organization (WHO)Trusted Source list the following less common symptoms:

a skin rash
conjunctivitis, known as pinkeye
discoloration of the fingers or toes
According to the WHO, about 80%Trusted Source of people with COVID-19 recover without needing hospital treatment. Around 20% become seriously ill and about 5% need intensive care.

<h2>HIV</h2>
<p>Attacks the immune system of its host. This makes the person vulnerable to other infections and diseases. A person can contract HIV as a result of contact with blood or other body fluids containing the virus.

  The symptoms of HIV may develop graduallyTrusted Source and in stages. They can include:
  
  fever
  chills
  rash
  mouth sores
  sore throat
  swollen lymph nodes
  night sweats
  muscle aches
  fatigue
  The only way a person can be certain they have HIV is to have an HIV test.
  
  Although there is no cure for HIV, medications can help to keep the virus under control or make it undetectable. Without such treatment, HIV can develop into AIDS.
  
  Learn more about undetectable HIV here.
  
  Other medications can help prevent a person from contracting HIV. People at high risk of HIV and those who believe they may have had exposure to it should speak with their primary healthcare professional about these options.

<h2>Tuberculosis</h2>
<p>A person may develop TB after inhaling Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) bacteria, primarily from person to person.

  When TB affects the lungs, the disease is the most contagious, but a person will usually only become sick after close contact with someone who has this type of TB.
  
  TB infection (latent TB)
  An individual can have TB bacteria in their body and never develop symptoms. In most people, the immune system can contain the bacteria so that they do not replicate and cause disease. In this case, a person will have TB infection but not active disease.
  
  Doctors refer to this as latent TB. An individual may never experience symptoms and be unaware that they have the infection. There is also no risk of passing on a latent infection to someone else. However, a person with latent TB still requires treatment.
  
  The CDC estimates that as many as 13 millionTrusted Source people in the U.S. have latent TB.
  
  TB disease (active TB)
  The body may be unable to contain TB bacteria. This is more common when the immune system is weakened due to illness or the use of certain medications.
  
  When this happens, the bacteria can replicate and cause symptoms, resulting in active TB. People with active TB can spread the infection.
  
  Without medical intervention, TB becomes active in 5–10%Trusted Source of people with the infection. According to the CDC, progression occurs within 2–5 years in about 50% of these people.
  
  The risk of developing active TB is higherTrusted Source in:
  
  anyone with a weakened immune system
  anyone who first developed the infection in the past 2–5 years
  older adults and young children
  people who inject recreational drugs
  people who have not previously received appropriate treatment for TB
  Learn more about pulmonary TB, which primarily affects the lungs, here.
  
  
  Symptoms
  Latent TB: A person with latent TB will have no symptoms, and no damage will show on a chest X-ray. However, a blood test or skin prick test will indicate that they have TB infection.
  
  Active TB: An individual with TB disease may experience a cough that produces phlegm, fatigue, a fever, chills, and a loss of appetite and weight. Symptoms typically worsen over time, but they can also spontaneously go away and return.
  
  Early warning signs
  A person should see a doctor if they experienceTrusted Source:
  
  a persistent cough, lasting at least 3 weeks
  phlegm, which may have blood in it, when they cough
  a loss of appetite and weight
  a general feeling of fatigue and being unwell
  swelling in the neck
  a fever
  night sweats
  chest pain
  Beyond the lungs
  TB usually affects the lungs, though symptoms can develop in other parts of the body. This is more common in people with weakened immune systems.
  
  TB can cause:
  
  persistently swollen lymph nodes, or “swollen glands”
  abdominal pain
  joint or bone pain
  confusion
  a persistent headacae</p>
