<p>The country's GDP growth has been among the highest in the world in the past decade – regularly achieving annual growth of between 6-7%.
  This rapid rise has been fueled by a number of factors, according to a 2016 McKinsey Global Institute report, including urbanization and technologies that have improved efficiency and productivity.
  India's real GDP, however, a measure that accounts for inflation, is forecast to slow in the year ahead thanks to credit weaknesses.</p>
<p>As recently as 2010, India was in 9th place, trailing countries such as Brazil and Italy.
 India's rise is even more dramatic across the past 25 years. Since 1995, the country's nominal GDP has jumped more than 700%.
