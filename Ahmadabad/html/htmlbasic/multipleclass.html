<h2>Maharani Tarabai</h2>
<p>Tarabai was the regent of the magnificent Maratha Empire in India for a few years in the early 1700s. Rarely has there been a female personality like her in Indian history who saved a kingdom from collapse through her sheer courage and willpower. A woman whose indomitable spirit was unarguably at par with that of the legendary Rani of Jhansi, she deserves more than a passing mention. The younger daughter-in-law of Chhatrapati Shivaji, she acted as regent of the Maratha Empire from 1700 to 1708 on behalf of her minor son, Shivaji II. At the time, the Maratha foothold was weakening due to constantly losing territories to Aurangzeb’s vast Mughal army. She not only oversaw the resistance against enemy occupation, but also planned and supervised many of her army’s raids and military operations. When her power was taken away from her first by Shahu, and later by Sambhaji II, she came back stronger each time. Thanks to her political acuity, she not only outlived her adversaries but also the Maratha Empire, given the crushing defeat it was dealt in 1761 in the 3rd Battle of Panipat at the hands of Ahmad Shah Abdali. In the pantheon of great Maratha warrior heroes, Tarabai has reserved for herself a special place.
  Tarabai was born on April 14, 1675, into the Mohite household of the Maratha Empire.
Her father, Hambirao Mohite was a famed commander-in-chief of the Maratha army. As a result, she was trained in the arts of archery, sword-fighting, military strategy and statecraft from an early age.
At the age of eight, she was married to Chhatrapati Shivaji’s younger son, Rajaram. This was at a time when the Mughals and the Marathas battled each other constantly to gain control over the Deccan.
n 1689, Chhatrapati Sambhaji was killed when Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb’s army laid siege to Raigad, and his wife, Yesubai, and son, Shahu, were taken prisoners.
Thus, the title of Chhatrapati passed on to Rajaram, who, along with Tarabai, had managed to escape the siege and reach Gingee Fort (Tamil Nadu), the southernmost post of the kingdom.
When the Mughal army laid siege to the fort, she took command owing to Rajaram’s deteriorating health and managed to hold the fort for eight years. There she also gave birth to Shivaji II in 1696.
With Rajaram succumbed to a chronic lung ailment in 1700, she declared her four-year-old son, Shivaji II, as the successor to the throne and thus became the queen regent, a title she held for eight years.
As regent, she led from the front. She successfully used Aurangzeb’s own tactics against his army and administration. Thus, her forces penetrated deep into the Mughal-held territories of Gujarat and Malwa by 1706. She even managed to appoint her own ‘kamaishdars’ (revenue collectors) in these territories.
