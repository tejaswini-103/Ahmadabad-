      <h3>Igneous Rock</h3>
      <p>Igneous rock is one of the three main rock types. Igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. Igneous rock may form with or without crystallisation, either below the surface as intrusive (plutonic) rocks or on the surface as extrusive (volcanic) rocks.</p>
      <p>this magma can be derived from partial melts of existing rocks in either a planet’s mantle or crust. Typically, the melting is caused by one or more of three processes: an increase in temperature, a decrease in pressure, or a change in composition
        Types of Igneous Rock
        Following are the two types of igneous rock:
        Intrusive igneous rock: These rocks crystallise below the earth’s surface resulting in large crystals as the cooling takes place slowly. Diorite, granite, and pegmatite are examples of intrusive igneous rocks.
        Extrusive igneous rock: These rocks erupt onto the surface resulting in small crystals as the cooling takes place quickly. The cooling rate for a few rocks is so quick that they form an amorphous glass. Basalt, tuff, and pumice are examples of extrusive igneous rock.</p>

      <h3>Sedimentary Rock</h3>
      <p>The sedimentary rocks are formed by the deposition and subsequent cementation of that material within bodies of water and at the surface of the earth. The process that causes various organic materials and minerals to settle in a place is termed sedimentation.

      </p>
      <p>The particles that form a sedimentary rock by accumulating are called sediment. Before being deposited, the sediment was formed by weathering and erosion from the source area and then transported to the place of deposition by water, wind, ice, mass movement or glaciers, which are called agents of denudation. Sedimentation may also occur as minerals precipitate from water solution or shells of aquatic creatures settle out of suspension.
        Sedimentary Rocks
        Types of Sedimentary Rock
        Following are the three types of sedimentary rock:
        Clastic sedimentary rocks: These rocks are formed from the mechanical weathering debris. Sandstone, and siltstone are examples of clastic sedimentary rocks.
        Chemical sedimentary rocks: These rocks are formed from the dissolved materials that precipitate from the solution. Iron ore and limestones are examples of chemical sedimentary rocks.
        Organic sedimentary rocks: These rocks are formed from the accumulation of plant and animal debris. Coal, and some dolomites are examples of organic sedimentary rocks.</p>

      <h3>Metamorphic Rocks
      </h3>        
      <p>The metamorphic rocks make up a large part of the Earth’s crust and are classified by texture and by chemical and mineral assemblage. They may be formed simply by being deep beneath the Earth’s surface, subjected to high temperatures and the great pressure of the rock layers above it.

      </p>
      <p>Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types, in a process called metamorphism, which means “change in form”. The original rock is subjected to heat with temperatures greater than 150 to 200°C and pressure around 1500 bars, causing profound physical and/or chemical change.
        Types of Metamorphic Rock
        Following are the two types of metamorphic rock:
        Foliated metamorphic rocks: These rocks are produced by exposure to heat and pressure which makes them appear layered. Phyllite and gneiss are examples of foliated metamorphic rocks.
        Non-foliated metamorphic rocks: These rocks don’t have layers. Marble and quartzite are examples of non-foliated metamorphic rocks.</p>
