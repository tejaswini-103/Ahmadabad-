    <h2>Nagpur</h2>
    <p>Nagpur, city, northeastern Maharashtra state, western India. It lies along the Nag River and is situated almost at the geographic centre of the country. The landscape in and around Nagpur consists of low flat-topped hills, flat tablelands, and deep, black, fertile soils in the valleys of streams and rivers. Pop. (2001) 2,052,066; (2011) 2,405,665.</p> 
    <p>The city was founded in the early 18th century by Bakht Buland, a Gond raja. It became the capital of the Bhonsles of the Maratha confederacy but in 1817 came under British influence. In 1853 the city lapsed into British control and in 1861 became the capital of the Central Provinces. The advent of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway in 1867 spurred its development as a trade centre. After Indian independence, Nagpur was briefly the capital of Madhya Pradesh state, until 1956, when it was included in the newly formed Bombay state, and then in 1960 it became part of what is now Maharashtra state.
      commerce and agricultural production, especially the growing of cotton in the region’s rich soils. Cotton production not only strengthened the area’s traditional hand-loom industry but also led to the establishment of a large textile mill and signaled the development of the city as an important industrial centre. Since that time, Nagpur’s industrial complex has diversified considerably. In the 1970s the city expanded to absorb the nearby town of Kamptee, with its factories that produce ferromanganese products, transport and farm equipment, and other metal goods from local mineral deposits (notably coal and manganese). The city, situated at the strategic junction of road, rail, and air routes from Mumbai (Bombay) to Kolkata (Calcutta) and from Chennai (Madras) to Delhi, also developed a flourishing trade sector. More recently, technology-related activities (especially software development) became more important. The end result was that Nagpur grew rapidly in size, its population doubling between 1981 and 2011.

    <h2>Chikhaldara</h2>
    <p>Chikhaldara is a hill station and a municipal council in Amravati district in the Indian state of Maharashtra.

      Chikaldhara, literally translates from Marathi to mud stream/falls (chikal + dhara). Hindus claim that this place was featured in the epic of the Mahabharata, this is the place where Bheema killed the villainous Keechaka in a herculean bout and then threw him into the valley. It thus came to be known as Keechakadara which eventually colloquialised to Chikaldhara. But there's not much evidence apart from hearsay to support that argument, nevertheless, it's an interesting story.
      
      The sole hill resort in the Vidarbha region, it is situated at an altitude of 1118 meters with highest elevation point 1188 meters and has the added dimension of being the only coffee-growing area in Maharashtra. Chikhaldara has an annual rainfall of 154cm. Temperatures vary from 39C in summer to 5C in winter. The best months to visit are from October to June.
      
      It abounds in wildlife, such as tigers, panthers, sloth bears, sambars, wild boar, and rarely seen wild dogs. Close by is the famous Melghat Tiger Project which has 82 tigers.
      
      The scenic beauty of Chikhaldara can be enjoyed from Hurricane Point, Prospect Point, and Devi Point. Other interesting excursions include Gavilgad and Narnala Fort, the Pandit Nehru Botanical Gardens, the Tribal Museum and the Semadoh Lake</p>
    <p>Chikhaldara was discovered by Captain Robinson of the Hyderabad Regiment in 1823. The Englishmen found it particularly attractive because the lush green hue of the place reminded them of England. When the leaves fell in September/October, they were reminded of autumn in England. There was even a proposal to make it the seat of the Government of India. British Commander selected leader of Chikhaldara named Mr.Sheikh Mehtab, who was landlord of Chikhaldara. He distributed land free of cost to Adivasis to build their houses. He ruled Chikhaldara for many years.
      Since the area is heavily forested and the population count is low there are no big festivals in Chikhaldara like in the rest of India. Only at the Jain temples that exist in the area, the pujas are held regularly Since the area is heavily forested and the population count is low there are no big festivals in Chikhaldara like in the rest of India.
