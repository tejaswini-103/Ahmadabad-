    <h2>Samsung galaxy S23 ULTRA</h2>
    <p> The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is the most premium device in Samsung’s S23 lineup. Its design, while premium and still unique, has not changed by much, but Samsung has made use of sustainable materials in its construction.
      The display is still the best you can get on an Android smartphone in India and offers the same high screen refresh rate as last year’s model, but its touch sampling rate fell short of our gaming expectations.
      A highlight of the Galaxy S23 Ultra is its unique processor which Samsung has customised to its own requirements. Software operation is buttery smooth but there are tons of bloatware both from Samsung and third-party apps, that can thankfully be uninstalled.
      Camera performance is better than last year’s Ultra and this is mainly down to the new sensor of the primary camera.</p>

    <h2>Samsung galaxy S23</h2>
    <p>The Galaxy S23 is a compact premium flagship smartphone from Samsung. The phone offers a design that is very similar to its predecessor and is made of glass and metal. While little has changed in terms of design, its compact form factor makes for easy one-handed usage.
      The phone has a 6.1-inch Super AMOLED display with a flat screen. Powering the smartphone is a customised Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor which offers more than enough power for day to day tasks and even gaming.
      Camera performance is quite good and is something one would expect from a premium flagship. The same can be said about the phone’s video recording quality. The phone is also capable of capturing 8K video at 30fps.
      Battery life is impressive for a compact device and the phone easily manages a full day of use on a single charge. However, wired charging is quite slow for a premium smartphon</p>

    <h2>OnePlus 11R</h2>
    <p>The OnePlus 11R 5G offers users a flagship-grade processor, the same primary camera as the 11 5G, and very quick charging — all at a starting price of Rs. 39,999. The OnePlus 11R 5G has a 6.74-inch display with the same curved edges on the left and right as the 11 5G, but with slightly narrower top and bottom bezels. 
      The OnePlus 11R 5G is powered by the very capable Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 SoC. This processor probably won't deliver the same benchmark numbers as the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, but is still plenty powerful for most practical use cases.
      The OnePlus 11R 5G will appeal to many OnePlus fans who have been waiting for something similar to the OnePlus 7T to come along — a phone with a proper flagship SoC under Rs. 40,000. If you're someone who plays a lot of demanding mobile games and require good battery life, the 11R 5G does not disappoint. </p>
