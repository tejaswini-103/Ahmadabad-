<h2>About Medicine</h2>
<p>What are Medicines?</p>
<P>Medicines or drugs are the natural or synthetic chemical compounds used to prevent or cure a disease, or they can also be used to relieve pain. Medicines are obtained from different sources. Some medicines are byproducts of certain microorganisms like bacteria, fungus, etc., for example, Penicillin from a fungus (Penicillium notatum). Some of these are biologically engineered by inserting genes into bacteria that make them produce the desired substance or medicine. There are fewer effective drugs against viruses than bacteria.

  Most medicines are used to cure a disease or condition. For example, antibiotics are given to cure an infection. Certain medicines are also given to treat a medical condition; for example, antidepressants are given to treat depression. Another use of medicine is to relieve symptoms of an illness. For example, pain relieves to reduce pain. Lastly, vaccines are also medicines that are used to prevent diseases in advance by stimulating the immune system of the body. For example, Covishield and Covaxin are the vaccines used to prevent Covid-19.</P>

<!-- Multiple elements with same class -->
<h2 class="medicine">Traditional medicines</h2>
<p> Traditional medicines are also called indigenous medicines or folk medicines.
  Traditional medicines are developed over generations within the fold beliefs of various societies before the modern era of medicine. Ayurvedic medicines are the traditional medicines of India.
  These types of medicines are mostly derived from plants or animals. These are not usually processed medicines.
  Traditional medicines can cause serious side effects to some patients. For example, a medicine with a high amount of alkaloid is toxic to the liver. </p>

<h2 class="medicine">Modern Medicines</h2>
<p>Modern medicines are medicines that are made in laboratories by scientists. These medicines are based on substances found in nature. 
  The active ingredients in modern medicines are identified, extracted, and purified. 
  After that, the medicines are tested repeatedly in many different ways before it is marketed. It allows scientists to make sure that the medicines are safe and to identify their side effects.  
  </p>
<p>Analgesics
  These are the medicines that are used to relieve pain without causing numbness or affecting consciousness. It does not treat the cause of pain but only provides relief from that pain. Some of the examples of analgesics are paracetamol, aspirin, and codeine. Antipyretics are medicinal preparation used to treat fever. The antipyretic analgesics drugs are a combination of an analgesic action with the ability to reduce body temperature during fever. Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, and Acetylsalicylic acid are the most commonly used antipyretic agents.Antibiotic
  Antibiotics are used to treat infectious diseases caused by microorganisms like bacteria and fungi. It cannot treat the infections caused by viruses such as cold and flu. Some of the examples of antibiotics are Penicillin, Tetracycline, Streptomycin, etc. Antibiotics can be broad-spectrum (ability to act on several pathogens) or narrow-spectrum (acts on only specific pathogens with a limited range of actions). Antibiotics should be used when prescribed by the doctor.
  
  Vaccines
  Vaccines are the preparation of a killed or weakened microbe extracted from the pathogen. It stimulates the immune system of the body against the microbe,  thereby preventing disease.  Vaccinations or immunisations work by stimulating the active immune system, the natural disease-fighting system of the body.
  
  Serum
  Serum is the pre-prepared antibodies from another source injected to build an immediate passive immunity. These antibodies containing serum are obtained from vaccinating animals such as horses or rabbits. When the immunity system of the animal produces antibodies against the weakened pathogen, these antibodies are separated from their blood cells by coagulation. On coagulation, the liquid left is called serum separates, which contains antibodies. It is stored and used for passive immunity. </p>

<h2 class="medicine">Drug Action</h2>
<p>Medicines affect only the rate at which existing biological functions have proceeded. 

  They do not change the basic nature of these biological functions or create new biological functions. For example, medicines can speed up or slow down the biochemical reactions that cause muscles to contract, glands to secrete substances (such as mucus, stomach acid, or insulin), kidney cells to regulate the volume of water and salts eliminated by the body, and nerves to transmit messages.
  
  Medicines cannot restore the functions or structures already damaged. This limitation of drug action underlies the current frustration in treating tissue-destroying or degenerative diseases such as arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease. 
  
  Some drugs can help the body repair itself. For example, antibiotics can allow the body to repair damage caused by the disease or infection by stopping an infection.
  
  Some medicines are hormones, such as insulin, estrogens, thyroid hormones, or cortisol. It can be used to replace natural hormones which are missing from the body.</p>

  <p>If the FDA (Food and Drugs Administration) considers a medicine safe enough to approve, it means that its benefits outweigh its known risks. The medications we use play an important role in overall health. All medicines have side effects, warnings, and drug interactions, so it’s important to understand the pros and cons of medicines.

    Benefits of medicines
    
    The benefits of medicines are the beneficial effects that help the body heal, ease pain, control blood sugar, lower blood pressure, and cure infections.
    Pharmaceutical medicines work faster to cure diseases and illnesses as compared to herbal medicines. They also have the capability to prevent other diseases and decrease mortality rates. 
    Besides pills and capsules, vaccines also help to fight disease and infection. Vaccination also helps the body to produce antibodies, and hence it strengthens immunity.
    Side-effects/Adverse effects of medicines: The risks or side-effects of medicines are the possible unwanted or unexpected effects that might happen to us when we use them. Side-effects can be minor, like a mild upset stomach, or more serious, such as an increased risk of bleeding or liver damage.
    
    Some of the mild adverse effects of medicines can be constipation, skin rash or dermatitis, dizziness, diarrhoea, headache, drowsiness, nausea, insomnia, etc.
    Some of the serious effects of medicines can be abnormal heart rhythm, suicidal thoughts, cancer, internalMedicine may also cause side effects like drug allergy, skin rash, liver inflammation, redness in the eye, throat infections, etc.  
    One of the most common effects of medicine is pharmaceutical drug abuse, due to which a person may become addicted to certain medications. 
    The misuse of pharmaceutical drugs may also cause the death of an individual.
